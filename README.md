## Business Insights (till Milestone 4)
- Nearly half of customers are classified as At-Risk, concentrated in Middle Aged and Adult groups—highlighting retention opportunities.
- Chinese cuisine receives the highest positive sentiment, with Loyal Promoters most prevalent here; insights help drive cuisine-specific campaigns.
- Positive sentiment and frequent visits do not always indicate loyalty, as Casual Neutrals dominate among weekly visitors.
- New columns for Persona and AgeGroup allow deeper demographic and behavioral analytics, empowering targeted outreach and reducing churn.
- The dashboard now delivers multidimensional views and granular segmentation, supporting smarter, personalized strategies for every segment.
